ImageSpec
=========

ImageSpec is a lightweight module designed to extract width/height dimensions from most standard image formats, as well as SWFs.

This is a work in progress.  I intend on expanding this to include other details (EXIF, various metadata, etc.) as well.


Example
=======

instance = ImageSpec::Dimensions.new('/path/to/your/file')

instance.width
instance.height

Pretty simple, huh?
